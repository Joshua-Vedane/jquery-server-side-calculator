# jQuery Server Side Calculator

## Description

This is a basic server-side calculator that can handle the four basic mathematical operations. All of the calculations and a history of previous calculations are handled on the server. The user can do any of the four calculations supported in the browser and see the result of the previous calculation as well as all previous calculations on the DOM. There is also a clear button that will clear the inputs and a delete button that wipes clean the calculation history. 

This program is built with JavaScript. The client side uses jQuery and Ajax to display data to the DOM and also to communicate with the server. 

The server is built with Javascript. It also utilizes Ajax as well as express and bodyParser.
